# TC4Tweaks

A mod that adds a bit of functionality and a bit of performance into thaumcraft 4.

## Compat

### Minetweaker 3

Any kind of reload will invalidate any cache used

### Gregtech 6

My quick and dirty patch of `generateItemHash()` will disable itself when GT6 is detected.

### Other stuff

The mod is tested with GTNH modpack and with latest thaumcraft 4 alone.
Other configuration should work but is not guaranteed.
Open a ticket in issues should you meet any problem.
